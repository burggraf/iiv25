# Is It Vegan? - React Native/Expo App Plan

## Project Overview
A cross-platform mobile app that allows users to scan food product barcodes and instantly determine if the product is vegan, vegetarian, or neither.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Deployment**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store
- **Barcode Scanning**: Expo Camera + Barcode Scanner
- **Product Data**: Open Food Facts API or similar
- **State Management**: React Context/Redux Toolkit
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements or NativeBase

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Scaffolding
1. Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
2. Set up project structure and folder organization
3. Configure development environment
4. Install core dependencies (navigation, UI library)
5. Set up version control and basic CI/CD

## Phase 2: Core Features Development
1. **Barcode Scanner Implementation**
   - Integrate Expo Camera for barcode scanning
   - Handle camera permissions
   - Parse barcode data (UPC/EAN codes)

2. **Product Data Integration**
   - Connect to Open Food Facts API
   - Parse ingredient lists
   - Implement vegan/vegetarian classification logic
   - Handle offline scenarios with local database

3. **User Interface**
   - Home screen with scan button
   - Camera view with scanning overlay
   - Results screen showing vegan status
   - Product details view
   - History/favorites functionality

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement search functionality (manual product lookup)
   - Add user preferences and settings
   - Include ingredient explanations

2. **Data & Performance**
   - Implement caching for scanned products
   - Add offline mode support
   - Optimize app performance and bundle size

## Phase 4: Deployment & Distribution
1. **App Store Preparation**
   - Generate app icons and splash screens
   - Configure app.json for both platforms
   - Test on physical devices
   - Prepare store listings and metadata

2. **Release Management**
   - Set up Expo Application Services (EAS)
   - Configure build pipelines
   - Submit to app stores
   - Set up analytics and crash reporting

## Development Commands
```bash
# Create new Expo project
npx create-expo-app@latest IsItVegan --template

# Development
npm start
npm run ios
npm run android

# Build for production
eas build --platform all
eas submit --platform all
```

## API Integration Notes
- **Open Food Facts API**: Free, comprehensive food database
- **Barcode Format**: Support UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8
- **Vegan Classification**: Parse ingredients for animal-derived products
- **Fallback**: Manual ingredient entry for unknown products

## Key Dependencies to Research
- expo-camera
- expo-barcode-scanner
- @react-navigation/native
- react-native-elements or nativebase
- axios for API calls
- react-native-async-storage

## Next Steps
1. Run `npx create-expo-app@latest IsItVegan --template` to scaffold the project
2. Set up the basic navigation structure
3. Implement barcode scanning functionality
4. Connect to food product API
5. Build the vegan classification logic
