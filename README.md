# Is It Vegan? ðŸŒ±

A React Native/Expo app that helps users determine if food products are vegan by scanning barcodes and ingredient labels.

## Features

- **Barcode Scanning**: Scan product barcodes to instantly check vegan status
- **Ingredient Analysis**: Take photos of ingredient lists for AI-powered analysis
- **Product Database**: Powered by Supabase with 400K+ products
- **Smart Classification**: Multi-strategy vegan detection system

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Supabase secrets (required for ingredient scanning)

   ```bash
   supabase secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

   Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
