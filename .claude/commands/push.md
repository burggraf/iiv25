Generate a detailed, clear, and concise git commit message describing the current changes in the repository.  
Then, execute the following shell commands in sequence:

1. `git add -A` (to stage all changes)
2. `git commit -m "<commit message>"` (replace `<commit message>` with the generated message)
3. `git push` (to push to the remote repository)

Only after providing the detailed commit message, confirm the commit and push commands.

Please produce only the commit message in your initial response, formatted for use in a git commit. Then, once I confirm, proceed with the actual commands.
