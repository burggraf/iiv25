I'm about to create a new testflight build and send it to Apple.
But first I need you to look through my git commits and create release notes. 
Look at all commits since my last commit that begins with "4.0.0-". (I usually add the build number such as 4.0.0-15 for build 15.)
Make release notes for my beta testers telling them what's changed, but only include things relevant to users, specifically beta testers.
Format this with no emoji's or special characters, or else Apple will not allow it.
No special characters of any kind, if you want to use bullet points use dashes or something simple.
Format this nicely on multiple lines (no \n stuff).
