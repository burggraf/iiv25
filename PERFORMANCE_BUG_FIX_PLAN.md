# Performance Bug Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Product Lookup Performance âœ… FIXED
**Status**: Completed in commit 78a81d4
- **Problem**: Redundant database calls in Add New Product workflow (17 calls total)
- **Impact**: Poor performance, unnecessary API usage
- **Solution**: Implemented job result transformation and request deduplication
- **Result**: 65% reduction in database calls (17 â†’ 6), 33.3% deduplication hit rate

### Issue 2: Camera Resource Management ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS  
**Status**: Ready to implement
- **Problem**: Camera resource conflicts causing app overheating and crashes when scanning multiple products
- **Symptoms**: 
  - App crashes after scanning 3 products in a row
  - iPhone overheating during camera usage
  - "File not readable" errors in background jobs
  - Memory buildup from camera operations
- **Root Causes**:
  - No centralized camera resource management
  - iOS automatically purges files from Camera cache directory
  - Memory accumulation from multiple photo captures
  - Concurrent camera operations without coordination
  - Base64 processing causing performance bottlenecks

### Issue 3: Image Processing Pipeline
**Status**: Needs investigation  
- **Problem**: ImageManipulator file access issues on iOS
- **Symptoms**: "File is not readable" errors even for files in Documents directory
- **Impact**: Background image processing jobs failing
- **Potential Solutions**:
  - Investigate iOS sandbox restrictions
  - Consider alternative image processing approaches
  - Implement fallback strategies for file access

## Implementation Approach

### For Issue 2 (Camera Resource Management):
1. **Create CameraService Singleton**
   - Centralized camera resource management
   - Memory monitoring and cleanup
   - Operation queuing to prevent conflicts

2. **Implement MemoryMonitor**
   - Track photo memory usage
   - Automatic cleanup of expired photos
   - Platform-specific memory thresholds

3. **File Management Strategy**
   - Move photos from iOS Camera cache to permanent Documents directory
   - Implement proper file lifecycle management
   - Handle iOS cache purging behavior

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry logic for camera operations
   - Graceful degradation when resources unavailable
   - User feedback for resource conflicts

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Issue 1: 65% reduction in database calls achieved
- ðŸŽ¯ Issue 2: Eliminate crashes when scanning multiple products consecutively  
- ðŸŽ¯ Issue 2: Reduce memory usage during camera operations
- ðŸŽ¯ Issue 2: Resolve "file not readable" errors in background jobs
- ðŸŽ¯ Issue 3: Stable image processing pipeline with <5% failure rate

## Testing Plan

1. **Stress Testing**: Scan 10+ products consecutively without crashes
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage during extended camera sessions  
3. **Background Job Reliability**: Ensure image processing jobs complete successfully
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure app responsiveness during camera operations
5. **Device Testing**: Test on multiple iOS devices and OS versions
